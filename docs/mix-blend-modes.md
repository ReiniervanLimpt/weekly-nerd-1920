## hiding/showing elements with mix-blend-mode

During the first course of the webdesign minor (CSS To The Rescue) i was asked to explore the limits of CSS, there is something cool i found out you could do with the `mix-blend-mode` property, you can see the result below.

Mix blend modes allow you to mix the colors of an element with the colors of its parent, i used this techinique together with an optical illusion trick i learned from watching [ this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvvcRdwNhGM) i created two SVG's one of which was an animation of 12 frames with all frames layered over one another and only 1/12 of iets content visible.
The second SVG is a black box with small openings which were 1/12 parts wide where the black bars are the remaining 11/12 parts this shows every section of each of the 12 animation frames individually when you move them over one another.

## Applying mix-blend-mode
As i explained above mix-blend-modes can be used to blend colors of elements layered over one another, the blend mode i used was: 

`multiply`: the element is multiplied by the background and replaces the background color. The resulting color is always as dark as the background.
I found out that some colors get completely blocked out depending on the color of its parent element.

### RGB colors
RGB colors are an additive color model, adding all colors together produces white. I used RGB colors to put on top of the cmyk colors of my animation.

### CMYK colors
CMYK is a subtractive color model, adding all colors together produces black. My animation is made up out of a cyan circle, a magenta triangle and a yellow square.

## Color substraction with blend modes
I used RBG and CMYK colors on top of eachother to subtract colors to make some of my shapes appear invisible.
* Green: consists of yellow and cyan, the `multiply` blend mode subtracts the cyan and yellow colors from the animation, the only color left is magenta (the triangle).
* Red: consists of yellow and magenta, the `multiply` blend mode subtracts these colors from the animation, the only remaining color is cyan (the circle)
* Blue: consists of magenta and cyan, the `multiply` bland mode subtracts these colors from the animation, the only remaining color is yellow (the square)

Knowing this i started by adding a couple of buttons that would change the color of the openings between the black bars that would come to cover the "visible" frames of the underlying SVG. After i got this working i applies the mix blend mode and voila! as expected the green overlay absorbed all colors except for the triangle and the other way around for the other colors.

Other mix-blend-mode values:
| value | explanation                                           |
| --------- | :----------------------------------------------------|
| `screen` |multiplies the background and the content then complements the result. This will result in content which is brighter than the |
| `overlay` | multiplies or screens the content depending on the background color. This is the inverse of the hard-light blend mode. |
| `color-dodge` | this attribute brightens the background color to reflect the color of the content. |
| `color-burn` | this darkens the background to reflect the contentâ€™s natural color. |
| `hard-light` | depending on the color of the content this attribute will screen or multiply it.|
| `soft-light` | depending on the color of the content this will darken or lighten it. |
| `difference` | this subtracts the darker of the two colors from the lightest color. |
| `exclusion` | similar to `difference` but with lower contrast. |
| `hue` | creates a color with the hue of the content combined with the saturation and luminosity of the background. |
| `saturation` | creates a color with the saturation of the content combined with the hue and luminosity of the background. |
| `color` | creates a color with the hue and saturation of the content and the luminosity of the background. |
| `luminosity` | creates a color with the luminosity of the content and the hue and saturation of the background. This is the inverse of the color attribute. |
